Configuration
-------------

This package is designed to provide tenant DNS from bastion hosts on
the ServerStack QA cloud.

Find out your openstack tenant id and place it in the tenant_ids file.
 
   echo $OS_TENANT_ID > /etc/serverstack-dns/tenant_ids

Edit /etc/serverstack-dns/dns.conf with your OpenStack credentials and the
rabbitmq access details your Cloud admin will provide you with.

After connecting to rabbit, it should process events for newly created and
deleted neutron ports.  If you confirm you can resolve nova instances by
their hostnames using the dnsmasq bastion server, you can update the
neutron network's subnet configuration and update the dns to point to your
bastion server.
