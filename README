This simple script listens on quantum/neutron's rabbitmq queue
for event notifications.  It responds to port create and port delete
events for the given tenant, and manages a dnsmasq host file with
correct entries for current instances.  You can configure the neutron
subnet to use this DNS server instead of the default, and have full
forward/reverse DNS from your tenant's instances.

$ sudo apt-get -y install python-novaclient python-kombu dnsmasq
$ sudo update-rc.d dnsmasq disable && sudo service dnsmasq stop
$ bzr branch lp:~gandelman-a/+junk/serverstack_dnsmasq
$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/serverstack && sudo chown ubuntu /etc/serverstack
$ cp serverstack_dnsmasq/bastion_dns.conf /etc/serverstack/bastion_dns.conf

Find out your openstack tenant id and place it in the tenant_ids file.
$ echo $OS_TENANT_ID > /etc/serverstack/tenant_ids

Edit /etc/serverstack/bastion_dns.conf accordingly

$ sudo ./manage_serverstack_tenant_dns.py

After connecting to rabbit, it should process events for newly created and
deleted neutron ports.  If you confirm you can resolve nova instances by
their hostnames using the dnsmasq bastion server, you can update the
neutron network's subnet configuration and update the dns to point to your
bastion server.

Note, when resetting DNS in neutron, your bastion server's resolv.conf
may get updated to point to the new dnsmasq local server.  Update it
manually to point to the correct upstream DNS.
